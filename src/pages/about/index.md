Hi, I'm Micah. I spend most of my time coding. I'm usually busy hacking away on node, typescript, or smart-contract projects. [Check out my github](https://github.com/micahriggan) to see what I'm currently working on.

Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micah-riggan) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micahriggan)

### Bitcore
I started working @ BitPay Jan 2018. So far my main project there is Bitcore v8. This iteration of Bitcore-Node uses MongoDb and Typescript. [Check it out on github](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/tree/v8.0.0)

### SplitCoin
[SplitCoin](www.app.splitcoin.io) was my first Dapp. It creates income splitting contracts which allow participants to receive their percentage of income

### This Site
This site is built with Netlify and Gatsby. All of the posts are Markdown YAML files and the templates are built in React. [Check it out on github](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms)
